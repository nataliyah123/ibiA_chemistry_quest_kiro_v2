# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create Smart Polling Manager service





  - Implement centralized polling management with pause/resume capabilities
  - Add Page Visibility API integration for automatic pause when tab is inactive
  - Include exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns for error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 3.3_
-

- [x] 2. Create user-controlled refresh components



  - Build RefreshControl component with manual refresh button and loading states
  - Implement auto-refresh toggle with configurable intervals
  - Add last updated timestamp display and refresh status indicators
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Optimize MonitoringDashboard component






  - Remove automatic 30-second setInterval polling mechanism
  - Integrate RefreshControl component for user-controlled updates
  - Implement pause/resume functionality when component unmounts or tab becomes inactive
  - Add error handling for failed refresh attempts with user feedback
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Create event-driven CSS monitoring system






  - Replace 5-second polling in useCSSMonitoringAlerts hook with event listeners
  - Implement CSS load/error event detection using MutationObserver and link element events
  - Add event aggregation to prevent alert spam from multiple similar errors
  - Create CSS error event emitter for centralized error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Implement Page Visibility API integration






  - Create usePageVisibility hook to detect tab visibility changes
  - Integrate with Smart Polling Manager to pause all polling when tab is inactive
  - Add user activity detection to resume polling when user returns
  - Implement reduced polling frequency for background tabs
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Add user preferences for refresh control





  - Create settings interface for configuring default refresh intervals
  - Implement localStorage persistence for user refresh preferences
  - Add bandwidth-aware polling that adjusts frequency based on connection speed
  - Create preference validation and fallback to safe defaults
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 2.3_

- [x] 7. Update CSS monitoring hook to use event-driven approach





  - Refactor useCSSMonitoringAlerts to remove setInterval polling
  - Implement event listeners for CSS load failures and parsing errors
  - Add debouncing for error reporting to prevent excessive API calls
  - Create cleanup mechanisms for event listeners on component unmount
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery





  - Implement exponential backoff for failed API calls in polling manager
  - Add circuit breaker pattern to stop polling after consecutive failures
  - Create user notifications for polling errors with manual retry options
  - Implement graceful degradation with cached data display
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 1.4_

- [x] 9. Create unit tests for polling optimization





  - Write tests for Smart Polling Manager pause/resume functionality
  - Test RefreshControl component user interactions and state management
  - Create tests for event-driven CSS monitoring with mock DOM events
  - Test Page Visibility API integration with simulated tab visibility changes
  - _Requirements: All requirements verification_

- [x] 10. Add integration tests for complete polling lifecycle








  - Test end-to-end polling behavior with real API calls and network conditions
  - Verify proper cleanup of intervals and event listeners on component unmount
  - Test error scenarios including network failures and API timeouts
  - Measure and verify reduction in API call frequency compared to baseline
  - _Requirements: All requirements verification_
