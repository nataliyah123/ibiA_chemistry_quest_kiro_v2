# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses frequent API calls and polling mechanisms that are causing unnecessary network traffic and potential performance issues in the ChemQuest application. The current implementation includes multiple components that poll APIs at regular intervals, which can lead to excessive server load and poor user experience, especially on slower connections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to reduce unnecessary API calls and polling to improve server performance and reduce bandwidth usage, so that the application runs more efficiently and costs less to operate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MonitoringDashboard component is loaded THEN it SHALL NOT make API calls every 30 seconds automatically
2. WHEN the CSS monitoring alerts system is active THEN it SHALL NOT check for errors every 5 seconds continuously
3. WHEN users are not actively viewing monitoring data THEN the system SHALL NOT continue polling for updates
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL use event-driven updates instead of continuous polling where possible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and not waste my bandwidth with unnecessary background requests, so that I have a better experience especially on mobile or slower connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate away from monitoring pages THEN background polling SHALL stop automatically
2. WHEN my connection is slow or limited THEN the application SHALL reduce polling frequency or use alternative update mechanisms
3. WHEN I'm on a mobile device THEN the application SHALL respect data usage preferences
4. WHEN the browser tab is not active THEN polling intervals SHALL be paused or significantly reduced

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement efficient update mechanisms that only fetch data when needed, so that the application is more maintainable and performs better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring data needs to be updated THEN the system SHALL use manual refresh buttons or user-triggered updates
2. WHEN CSS errors occur THEN the system SHALL use event-driven notifications instead of continuous polling
3. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL consider WebSocket connections or Server-Sent Events
4. WHEN implementing polling THEN it SHALL include proper cleanup and pause mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have control over when data is refreshed, so that I can manage my bandwidth usage and get updates when I actually need them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing monitoring dashboards THEN I SHALL have manual refresh buttons available
2. WHEN I want real-time updates THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable auto-refresh with clear indicators
3. WHEN auto-refresh is enabled THEN I SHALL be able to configure the refresh interval
4. WHEN the page loses focus THEN auto-refresh SHALL pause automatically and resume when I return
