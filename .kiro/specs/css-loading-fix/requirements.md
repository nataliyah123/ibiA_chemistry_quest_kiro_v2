# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the CSS loading issue where users lose all styling after successful login/authentication. The problem occurs when users navigate from the login page to authenticated pages, resulting in unstyled content that impacts user experience and application usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application styling to remain consistent after login, so that I can continue using the application with proper visual presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the application SHALL maintain all CSS styling on subsequent pages
2. WHEN a user navigates between authenticated pages THEN the application SHALL preserve consistent styling throughout the session
3. WHEN the application loads after authentication THEN all CSS assets SHALL be properly loaded and applied

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS assets to be properly served and cached, so that styling remains available across all application states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client application builds THEN all CSS assets SHALL be properly included in the distribution bundle
2. WHEN the web server serves static assets THEN CSS files SHALL be accessible with correct MIME types and caching headers
3. WHEN a user refreshes an authenticated page THEN the CSS assets SHALL reload successfully without requiring re-authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle CSS loading errors gracefully, so that I can still use the application even if styling issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF CSS assets fail to load THEN the application SHALL provide fallback styling or error handling
2. WHEN CSS loading fails THEN the application SHALL log appropriate error messages for debugging
3. WHEN styling issues are detected THEN the application SHALL attempt to reload CSS assets automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and deployment process to ensure CSS assets are properly configured, so that styling issues don't occur in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client application builds THEN the build process SHALL verify all CSS assets are included and accessible
2. WHEN containers are deployed THEN the nginx configuration SHALL properly serve static CSS assets
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all required CSS files SHALL be available at their expected paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vite development server to work properly in Docker containers, so that CSS assets and WebSocket connections function correctly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vite development server runs in Docker THEN the HMR WebSocket connection SHALL establish successfully
2. WHEN CSS assets are requested in development mode THEN they SHALL be served with 200 status codes
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL be accessible from both container and host environments
4. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the application SHALL provide fallback mechanisms for asset loading
